# 🎬 Film Genre Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
As a data analyst passionate about storytelling and data-driven decisions, I took on this project to help a filmmaking company determine the most profitable genre for their next production. Using Excel and pivot tables, I analyzed movie revenue, budgets, and profitability to uncover insights that can guide future investments in the film industry.  

## 🔍 Business Questions  
1. **Revenue by Genre** – On average, how much money do movies make in each genre?  
2. **Budget by Genre** – On average, how much money is spent on a movie, broken down by genre?  
3. **Profitability by Genre** – On average, which genre has the most profitable movies?  

## 🛠 Solution Approach  
To answer these questions, I followed these steps:  

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Imported the dataset into Excel.  
   - Checked for missing values and inconsistencies in genre classification.  

2. **Data Analysis Using Pivot Tables**  
   - Created pivot tables to calculate average revenue, budget, and profitability for each genre.  
   - Used calculated fields to determine profit margins.  
   - Sorted and filtered data to identify the most profitable genre.  

3. **Findings & Insights**  
   - *[Example: Action movies generated the highest average revenue, while Horror movies had the highest profit margin.]*  
   - *[Example: Drama films had the highest budgets, but their profitability was lower compared to other genres.]*  

## 📊 Tools Used  
- **Microsoft Excel** (Pivot Tables, Formulas, Data Cleaning)  

## 📂 Project Files  
- `movies_data.xlsx` – Raw dataset used for analysis  
- `pivot_analysis.xlsx` – Processed file with pivot tables and insights  
- `README.md` – Project details and findings  

## 📈 Key Takeaways & Recommendations  
- *[Example: If the goal is high revenue, the company should consider producing Action films.]*  
- *[Example: If the focus is profitability, Horror films offer a lower-budget, high-profit option.]*
